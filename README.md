## Projects

### Loan Defaulter Machine Learning Classification Project [Python, scikit-learn, Applied Machine Learning]
[GitHub Repository Link]()

Business Case: Develop a Machine Learning model for the company to identify if the loan applicant is likely or unlikely to default on the loan, thereby assisting in the company's portfolio & risk assessment capabilities

Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA] & model testing was conducted using **Python** within the **JupyterNotebook** environment. Various feature engineering techniques & models were experimented on & the best AUC scoring model was then selected & applied to form the final model.

The final model, along with the feature-engineered dataframe, acheived a **~90% predictive AUC score** after cross-validation via the Kaggle platform, thus demonstrating a strong ablity to discriminate between loan applicants whom are likely or unlikely to default on loans,

### Hotel Revenue Analysis [PowerBI, PowerQuery M, T-SQL, SQL Server Management Studio, Excel, PowerPoint]
[PowerBI Dashboard Link]()
[Slide Link]()
[GitHub Repository Link]()
• Business Case: A business manager of a chain of hotel would like to request help from the data analytics team to develop a dashboard to analyze & visualize hotel booking data
• The business manager is interested if there’s any patterns/ seasonality with respect to:
  1. Guests
  2. Revenue
Requirement: Build a Dashboard using PowerBI to provide at-a-glance information about features that are relevant to revenue

End-to-end data analytics project. Data from raw .csv file was ingested into **SQL Server Management Studio [SSMS]**, from which SQL queries were iteratively built upon to obtain the final output which was then imported into SSMS for data analysis & visualization. Additional data processing was done in PowerBI with PowerQuery M for visualization purposes. Guests, revenue seasonality, recommendation for staffing arrangement, and dataset limitations were explained with the help of additional visualizations done in PowerBI.

[Accompanying JupyterNotebook Link]()
[Accompanying SQL Code Block Link]()

Business Case:
• The data analytics manager of a company would like to seek insights into salary disparities present within the company department

Objective:
• Obtain relevant insights with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and create a SQL query that identifies a high amount of variation within the department
• Provide the top 5 department that should be selected for management to review, with regards to having the most variance & discrepancy in salary

Deliverables:
• Provide a list from a SQL database with a way to score variation by Department
• JupyterNotebook with accompanying Python code block for SQL calculation cross-validation & EDA

End-to-end data analytics project. Data from raw .csv file was ingested into **SQL Server Management Studio [SSMS]**, from which SQL queries were iteratively built upon to obtain the final output which included the departmental:
1. Standard Deviation
2. Average Salary
3. Coefficient Of Variation
4. Outlier Count based off Z-Score values
Through which, the top 5 departments were selected for management to review, along with reasonings, based on the calculated output

### Analysis of Credit Card Churning Customers [Tableau, Powerpoint]
[Tableau Public Link]()
[Slide Link]()
Analysis of attritted bank customers were performed based on various qualitative & quantitative measures using **Tableau** for data visualization. Relevant recommendations that the bank can undertake to alleviate churning customers were proposed. Limitations of the dataset which may lead to analytics bias was also discussed.

### Numerical Investigation of Pressure Drop at Turbulent Flow Conditions in Single Pellet String Reactors [LaTeX, OpenFOAM®, ParaView, Linux]
[Thesis Link]()
Achieved distinction for thesis.
Application of C++ in **OpenFOAM®** for the model, mesh generation and turbulent fluid simulation via RANS with the k-ω-SST model in a single pellet string reactor using Bash Scripting in **Ubuntu**. ParaView is used as both the GUI and post-processing tool to extract pressure drop, along with other parameters of interest. **LaTeX** was used for relevant graph plotting and the aggregation of all findings into a presentable format.
